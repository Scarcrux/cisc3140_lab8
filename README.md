Examples of exercises for each of the learning objectives:

- Check if an input string is a palindrome, return a boolean value. Allow list input type.
- Create a lambda expression that evaluates a sum of series (i.e. fibonacci sequence) given a number input n.
- Create a function that will calculate two input parameters, but only if they're both valid types for calculation. Use Scheme's syntax and available functions for checking types.
